##Investment analysis system

• Coursework concerns management + analysis of investments.
• An investor may purchase bonds. A bond has a term (number of years to expiry), coupon (percentage of investment, paid to investor at regular intervals),
frequency of payments. Bonds have names, eg. “UK government bond” and purchase date.
• Assume frequency = 1 per year, investment = 100.
• Investors receive back invested sum at term, + final coupon payment.

Eg., invest £100 in bond b paying 10% coupon annually for 5 years. 4 payments of £10, one of £110.
System enables new bonds to be defined + added to investor’s portfolio.

• Bonds have a price: investor pays this with sum invested
• System should compute and display the payout of all bonds: sum of payments.
£150 in example.
